# style_transfer
Style transfer with TensorFlow.

This tutorial uses the algorithm proposed by Gatys et al. on [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) paper. <br />


I based this tutorial on the following implementations:
* hwalsuklee's [tensorflow-style-transfer](https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-style-transfer)
* anishathalye's [neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style)
